"""
No programming needed for D08-1
1. File size: 6795, 300x2 whitespaces (0D 0A), thus 6195 code characters
2. replace \\, \" and \x?? with something,
account for "" at the beginning and end of the lines,
giving total of 1200 chars to substract.
Filesize now: 6045, so string memory value: 4845 

Part2:
+4*300 for outside quotes
+1 per each \ and +1 more for each correct \" 
(615) + 275-5  = 885, too low :-(
886 low 22:37
1006 low 22:52
1126 ? 23:02
1125 ? 23:10
2085 - ok (forgot that +4*300 at the beginning)
